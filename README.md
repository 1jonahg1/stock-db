# stock-db

The website presents stock info and allows the user to add\remove stocks and filter the existing stocks in the db based on entered parameters.

The site runs on fast api (with minor use of pydantic) and is presented with semantic UI tools.
The stock info is acquired through the yfinance api and stored with sqlalchemy. 
The app is deployed with a Docker.
